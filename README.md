# Nexo

A programming language that I created to learn how other programming languages work.


## Examples

    > (2 + 2) * 2
    8
    > let x = 5
    > print(x)
    5
    > x = 10
    > print(x)
    10

  
   


### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Miziolek/nexo.git
